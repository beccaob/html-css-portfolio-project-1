            <h2>Who We Are <i class="fa-solid fa-user-group"></i></h2><br>
            <p>We're a group of professionally trained musicians who would like to pass our knowledge to the younger
                generation of Fermoy and it's surrounding areas.</p><br>

            <h2>What We Do <i class="fa-solid fa-handshake-angle"></i></h2><br>
            <p> We provide workshops in Piano, Drums, Bass, Vocals,
                Music Theory & Electric/Acoustic Guitar. For our older groups, we offer a Songwriting 101 workshop where
                they learn the basics of songwriting, rhyme and structure.<br>There's something for everyone at The
                Ryhthm Lounge! </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Why We're Here <i class="fa-solid fa-handshake-angle"></i></h2><br>
            <p>We aim to inspire students to appreciate the arts, motivate them to play an instrument and teach
                them ways to incorporate music into their daily lives. Through our workshops, we provide tools that
                empower youth and promote their creativity, social development and self-worth. We intentionally expose
                students to a broad spectrum of music, so they become inspired to choose their own musical paths for the
                future. </p>

        </div>

            <h2>Increased Coordination <i class="fa-solid fa-hands-clapping"></i></h2><br>
            <p>Just like playing sports, playing and dancing to music helps children develop their motor skills. Making
                music involves more than the voice or fingers; you also use ears and eyes, as well as large and small
                muscles, all at the same time. This helps the body and the mind work together. </p><br>

            <h2>Social Skills <i class="fa-solid fa-handshake-angle"></i></h2><br>
            <p>Making music with other people improves children’s social and emotional skills. They learn to work
                together as a team and develop their sense of empathy with others. </p><br>

            <h2>Achievement & Discipline <i class="fa-solid fa-trophy"></i></h2><br>
            <p>Learning music teaches children to work towards short-term goals, develop routine and practice
                self-discipline. Setting aside regular time for practice develops commitment and patience. Mastering a
                new piece of music leads to a sense of pride and achievement, and helps children to learn the value of
                self-discipline. </p><br>

            <h2>Maths Skills <i class="fa-solid fa-calculator"></i></h2><br>
            <p>Music can help with the development of maths skills. By listening to musical beats your child can learn
                basic fractions, pattern-recognition and problem solving. </p><br>
